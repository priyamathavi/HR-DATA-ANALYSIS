This dashboard provides HR analytics insights to a company called AtliQ. AtliQ was facing a challenge as they were operating in a hybrid mode, with employees working both remotely from home and in the office. They required a comprehensive analysis of employee attendance and presence for the past three months.
The company's concerns included determining the percentage of employee presence to assess engagement and the effectiveness of the hybrid work model. They also aimed to understand employees' working preferences between home and the office to inform future work arrangements. Additionally, AtliQ sought to analyze sick leave data to identify patterns and reasons for absences, aiding in evaluating employee well-being and promoting a healthy work environment.
